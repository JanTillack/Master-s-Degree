Apple stopped selling the M1 Air with its newest release, but now Walmart is carrying the torch, selling new M1 Airs for $699. The systems can be purchased from Walmart.com, though a press release says the discounted Air will be available in \\\"select Walmart stores.\\\"\\n\\nWalmart only has one configuration available: the former base model. This model has an 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB SSD. It's admittedly not the most powerful (it was released in 2020) or the most roomy. While many Mac fans would like to see 16GB of RAM become the standard, it's hard to argue against 8GB at this price.\\u00a0M1 MacBook Air is $699 at Walmart\\nThe M1 MacBook Air has 8GB of RAM and 256GB in its starting configuration, but is powerful enough for basic tasks and lasts a long time on a charge.View DealThe M1 MacBook Air served as Apple's entry point to Mac laptops for a while after its 2020 launch and was only just replaced by the M2 MacBook Air in that role. This new $699 price beats plenty of deals we had seen for the M1 Air, like a drop to $749 over the holidays. It's an especially good price considering Apple is still selling the laptop for $759 refurbished, and this one is new in the box.\\n\\nThe M1 is a few years old, but should still be solid for basic productivity tasks. More importantly, the battery life should still be impressive. There are definitely more powerful machines out there from just about every vendor, but if you're set on a Mac and are on a budget, this may be an enticing starting point.\\n\\nThis is the first time that Walmart is selling the Mac directly, but it's unclear exactly how long it will last. Perhaps Walmart bought the last of Apple's stock, or maybe Apple is still quietly making them but letting Walmart take the lead on selling them.\\n\\nWhen the MacBook Air M1 slipped off Apple's webpage, some fans said they would miss the iconic wedge design. While Apple has clearly moved on with its most recent, more rectangular MacBook Airs, wedge fans can still get that design a bit longer\\u2014and, for a Mac, on the cheap.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\\n\",\n          \"\\nNvidia this year became the world's most valuable semiconductor company with a value of over $1 trillion. The company earns more money than Intel and other tech giants, and yet Jensen Huang's management style is quite unconventional, as it turns out, with no long-term planning and 40 direct reports, among other interesting tidbits. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined his management philosophy in an interview with Joel Hellermark conducted earlier this year (and recently noticed by analyst\\u00a0Dan Hockenmaier), giving a unique insight into the radically different way that Huang manages his company. \\u00a040 Direct Reports, No 1:1 MeetingsHuang avoids typical hierarchical communication and maintains a flat organizational structure, with as many as 40 direct reports. Meanwhile, he avoids 1:1 meetings, preferring group discussions that ensure everyone is on the same level, starting right from the top.\\u00a0Huang places a strong emphasis on continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends and innovations in the industry. One of the ways he does this is by surrounding himself with knowledgeable individuals who are willing to share their expertise.Meetings at Nvidia are not restricted by rank or position. Everyone, from VPs to entry-level employees, has access to all information and can join any meeting, according to Huang. Huang's philosophy revolves around the idea that if there's a strategic direction or decision to be made, why limit the information to a select few?\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\"If there is a strategic direction, why do you tell one person,\\\" Huang asked rhetorically. \\\"You tell everybody, and so after, we are swimming in the soup of strategizing and how to formulate the path to the future. When the time comes, I will send it out to everybody at the same time, or I will tell everybody at the same time, and people will give me feedback, and we will refine it.\\\"Share Strategic Directions, No Solid PlansBy sharing the strategic direction of the company with everyone, Huang says he opens the door for feedback from various perspectives. This collective approach is designed to harness the intelligence and expertise of the entire organization, leading to refined and well-thought-out strategies.When it comes to strategies, Nvidia certainly follows its own path. In terms of planning, Huang believes that rigid long-term plans can sometimes be restrictive. Therefore, he doesn't set long-term or short-term plans. Instead, the company adopts a flexible approach, constantly re-evaluating its strategies based on the ever-evolving business and market conditions, according to Huang. This is particularly crucial given the rapid advancements in the field of AI, where adaptability can be a significant advantage.\\\"We don't do a periodic planning system,\\\" said Huang. \\\"The reason for that is because the world is a living, breathing thing. So, we just plan continuously; there is no five-year plan, there is no one-year plan, there is no plan \\u2014 there is just what we are doing.\\\"Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.To speed up the decision-making process and stay up-to-date with realities, Huang gave up usual status reports. He feels that by the time status updates reach him, they often lose their \\\"ground truth\\\" (original essence and authenticity). To counteract this, he encourages any employee to email him their immediate 'top five things' on their mind. Every morning, he dedicates time to reading around 100 of these emails, ensuring he is in touch with the ground realities of his company.Think Outside the Box, Leave Commodity MarketsHuang says the core mission of Nvidia is to tackle challenges that are on the edge of what's currently possible, pushing the envelope of what conventional computers can achieve rather than solving regular computing problems. In fact, Huang believes in walking away from businesses or sectors that have become commoditized, which is why Nvidia left the smartphone and tablet SoC market a few years ago. Huang feels this approach drives technological advancements and sets Nvidia apart from rivals.\\u00a0However, making decisions that deviate from the norm or established playbooks can be challenging. Instead of following established practices, Huang suggests breaking down problems into their fundamental truths and building solutions from there, saying this approach encourages innovative thinking and often leads to groundbreaking solutions that traditional methods might overlook. Another way Huang says he deviates from established practices is by trusting his intuition to 'make the right decisions at the right time.'Huang describes Nvidia's organizational structure as having three primary objectives: attracting the best talent in the industry, operating with a lean and efficient team, and ensuring that information flows swiftly and effectively throughout the company.The merits of different management styles often come with many tradeoffs, and we don't get to see that side of the picture in the one-sided description. However, it is clear that Huang's unique style is designed to retain much of the flexibility you would see with a start-up, as opposed to the rigid hierarchical organizations at large incumbents that often become mired down in internal bureaucracy and then begin to stagnate. Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth now as it has essentially cornered many aspects of the explosive GPU market, but how this streamlined management style will work as the company becomes larger remains a question, along with whether or not a successor could succeed in replicating the approach.\\n\",\n          \"\\nOne of our favorite gaming headsets and winner of a coveted Editor's Choice award, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless gaming headset is down to $299 after receiving a whopping $50 discount if you use code SSCV2826 at Newegg.

The trade show traditionally attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors, making it one of the biggest gaming events in the world.\\u00a0The fair is aimed at the general public and industry professionals. The event is split between an Entertainment Area for the public, where fans can try out upcoming games, and a Business Area for trade visitors to\\u00a0communicate\\u00a0and conduct deals.\\u00a0AMD plans to hold its AMD Gaming Festival 2023 on Friday, August 25, at Hall 7, which starts at 12:00.\\nWhile AMD does not disclose what exactly it plans to announce at Gamescom, it is about time for AMD to fill a gap in its Radeon RX 7000-series product line that spans from the Radeon RX 7600 ($270) and goes all the way to the Radeon RX 7900 XT ($900).\\u00a0This void is currently being filled by the older Radeon RX 6000-series\\u00a0and the Radeon RX 7900 GRE ($650), which is hard to get. Essentially, AMD\\u00a0does\\u00a0not have a direct answer to NVIDIA's reasonably popular GeForce RTX 4070 at the moment.\\nIt's speculated that AMD's next move is to unveil the Navi 32, a GPU from its RDNA 3-based lineup which would position itself between the existing Navi 31 and Navi 33 GPUs. AMD's Navi 32 is anticipated to be the foundation for the Radeon RX 7700 and Radeon RX 7800 series, which will compete against Nvidia's performance mainstream and higher-end GeForce RTX 40-series products.\\n\",\n          \"\\nIn what appears to be a mistake or a jump of the gun by ASUS, they have seemingly published a list of specifications for one of its key notebooks that all but allude to the next generation of AMD's mobile processors. While we saw AMD toy with a new nomenclature for their Phoenix silicon (Ryzen 7040 series), it seems as though AMD is once again changing things around where their naming scheme for processors is concerned.\\nThe ASUS listing, which has now since been deleted, but as of writing is still available through Google's cache, highlights a model that is already in existence, the VivoBook S 16 OLED (M5606), but is listed with an unknown AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 170 processor. Which, based on its specificiations, is certainly not part of the current Hawk Point (Phoenix/Phoenix 2) platform.\\n\\nThe cache on Google shows the ASUS Vivobook S 16 OLED with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 170 Processor\\nWhile it does happen in this industry occasionally, what looks like an\\u00a0accidental leak by ASUS on one of their product pages has unearthed an unknown processor from AMD.\\u00a0This first came to our attention via a post on Twitter by user @harukaze5719. While we don't speculate on rumors, we\\u00a0confirmed this ourselves by digging through\\u00a0Google's cache. Sure enough, as the image above from Google highlights, it lists a newly unannounced model of Ryzen mobile processor. Under the listing via the product compare section for the ASUS Vivobook S 16 OLED (M5606) notebook, it is listed with\\u00a0the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 170, which appears to be one of AMD's upcoming Zen 5-based mobile chips codenamed Strix Point.\\nSo with the seemingly new nomenclature that AMD has gone with, it has a clear focus on AI, or rather Ryzen AI, by including it in the name. The Ryzen AI 9 HX 170 looks set to be a 12C/24T Zen 5 mobile variant, with their Ryzen AI NPU or similar integrated within the chip. Given that Microsoft has defined that only processors with an NPU with 45 TOPS of performance or over constitute being considered an 'AI PC', it's likely the Xilinx (now AMD Xilinx) based NPU will meet these requirements as the listing states the chip has up to 77 TOPS of AI performance available. The HX series is strikingly similar to AMD's (and Intel's) previous HX naming series for their desktop replacement SKUs for laptops, so assuming any of the details of ASUS's error are correct, then this is presumably a very high-end, high-TDP part.\\n\\nAMD Laptop Roadmap from Zen 2 in 2019 to Zen 5 on track for release in 2024\\nWe've known for some time that AMD plans to release AMD's Zen 5-based Strix Point line-up sometime in 2024.\\u00a0Given the timing\\u00a0of Computex 2024, which is just over four weeks away, we still don't quite have the full picture of Zen 5's performance and its architectural shift\\u00a0over Zen 4. AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su also confirmed that Zen 5 will come with enhanced RDNA graphics within the Strix Point SoC by stating \\\"Strix combines our next-gen Zen 5 core with enhanced RDNA graphics and an updated Ryzen AI engine to significantly increase the performance, energy efficiency, and AI capabilities of PCs,\\\"\\nWhile it's entirely possible as we lead up to Computex 2024 that AMD is prepared to announce more details about Zen 5, nothing is confirmed. We do know that the CEO of AMD, Dr. Lisa Su is scheduled to deliver the opening keynote of the show, Dr. Lisa Su unveiled their Zen 4 microarchitecture at Computex 2022 during AMD's keynote and even unveiled their 3D V-Cache stacking, which we know today as the Ryzen X3D CPUs back at Computex 2021.\\nWith that in mind, AMD and Dr. Lisa Su love to announce new products and architectures at Computex, so we just have to wait until the beginning of next month.\\u00a0How AMD denotes the nomenclature for the upcoming Zen 5 mobile and desktop processors remains to be seen, but hopefully, all will be revealed soon. Regarding the ASUS Vivobook S 16 OLED (M5606), we currently don't know any of the other specifications at this time. Still,\\u00a0we expect them to be available once AMD has updated us with information on Zen 5 and Strix Point.\\n\",\n          \"\\nAs first hinted at by Intel back in late April, Intel is embarking on a journey to redefine its client processor branding, the biggest such shift in the previous 15 years of the company. Having already made waves by altering its retail packaging on premium desktop chips such as the Core i9-11900K and Core i9-12900K, the tech giant aims to introduce a new naming scheme across its client processors, signaling a transformative phase in its client roadmap.\\nThis shift is due to begin in the second half of the year, when Intel will launch their highly anticipated Meteor Lake CPUs. Meteor Lake represents a significant leap forward for the company in regards to manufacturing, architecture, and design \\u2013 and, it would seem, is prompting the need for a fresh product naming convention.\\nThe most important changes include dropping the 'i' from the naming scheme and opting for a more straightforward Core 3, 5, and 7 branding structure for Intel's mainstream processors. The other notable inclusion, which is now officially confirmed, is that Intel will bifurcate the Core brand a bit and place its premium client products in their own category, using the new Ultra moniker. Ultra chips will signify a higher performance tier and target market for the parts, and will be the only place Intel uses their top-end Core 9 (previously i9) branding.\\nIntel: A Brief History of the Core i Series\\nThe Core i series debuted in 2008, around 15 years ago, marking the end of the first Core/Core 2 era and signaling a new dawn for Intel's client product lines. This change happened alongside the release of its 45 nm manufacturing process through the Nehalem architecture and covered products such as Celeron, Pentium Core, and the Xeon brands. More recently,\\u00a0in 2020, Intel initiated a more comprehensive overhaul of its corporate identity to modernize the messaging from a 50 year old company, the effects of which are still winding through the company today.\\nThis revamp of Intel's\\u00a0 branding has involved the introduction of new trademarks and logos characterized by cleaner typography and simplistic geometric backgrounds with a lighter blue color scheme. As part of this process, Intel has previously bid farewell to its long-established budget CPU brands, Pentium and Celeron. These branding changes were undoubtedly intended to convey a\\u00a0willingness to change, transcend, and solidify their position in an emerging market.\\nGoing from the older Core Duo branding to the Core i3 series marked the dawn of Intel's modern low-end processor branding, with the quantitative markup of their other lineups into the Core i5 (mid-range) and the Core i7 series\\u00a0\\u2013 which at the time, was reserved for Intel's flagship processors.\\nGoing Forward: Deemphasizing Generational Branding\\nThe latest branding change, as previously mentioned, is the biggest in the last 15 years of Intel. While some naming schemes can be confusing and cluttered (ahem, Xeons), Intel is aiming for something that's still reasonably clear for the client processors. Which is great timing, because the hardware underpinning them is about to get fairly complex with the transition chiplet-based Meteor Lake and its mix-and-match of dies built on the Intel 4 process and built over at rival-supplier TSMC.\\nFirst and foremost, under their new branding system Intel is doing away with leading generational branding. For the last decade plus, we've seen Intel slowly increment through their Core generations, such as 4th Gen Core, 9th Gen Core, 13th Gen Core, etc. Often, this was placed in front of the processor description (especially on OEM devices), giving us descriptions such as \\\"Intel 11th Generation Core i3\\\".\\n\\nUnder Intel's new branding change, the processor generation is being deemphasized \\u2013 but not eliminated entirely. The processor model numbers themselves will still start with the generation as they do today, but that will be the only place where the generation will be consistently denoted. Generation as a leading indicator will be going away.\\nAt this point, we don't know where Intel will start their latest numbering system from. While Intel could very well continue on from where they've left off, making the next parts the 14th Generation (and thus 14xxx model numbers), more likely Intel is going to use this as a chance to reset their generation count. The benchmark data leaks that caused Intel to initially comment on this matter back in April included mention of a 1003H chip, for what that's worth.\\nIntel Core 3, Core 5, and Core 7 for Mainstream: Dropping the Iconic 'i'\\nAs part of the new rebranding, Intel is dropping the 'i' from their processor tiering system for client processors, starting with Meteor Lake and other products on the roadmap beyond this. This means that the Core i3, i5, and i7 naming structure becomes Core 3, 5, and 7, effectively dropping the 'i' moniker\\u00a0of the naming structure.\\n\\nThis means chips such as the Core i5 13600 would be named something like Core 5 13600 under the new naming convention. This doesn't constitute a massive change in the naming, but is significant as the 'i' has\\u00a0been\\u00a0an iconic moniker for its processors over the last 15 years.\\nNotably here, this tier of Core branding is what Intel considers their \\\"mainstream\\\" processors. It doesn't cover Core 9 in any way \\u2013 that tier is reserved for Intel's premium \\\"Ultra\\\" brand.\\nIntel Core Ultra: Reserved For Premium Chips - Core Ultra 5, Ultra 7, and Ultra 9\\nIntel is also officially splitting off its premium client chips into their own sub-brand of sorts, giving them the new Ultra label. Intel's Core Ultra branding is reserved for their \\\"premium\\\" processors, which the company isn't strictly defining what that means in advance. So how this will fit into the Meteor Lake generation of processors remains to be seen. Though on the desktop, we wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see this replace (or go hand-in-hand with) Intel's traditional K/KS series SKUs.\\u00a0\\n\\nReading between the lines here, it's interesting to note that, unlike Intel's slide for mainstream processors, which says \\\"Beginning with Meteor Lake\\\", Intel's Ultra changes are \\\"Beginning 2H 2023\\\". There is still a lot of cloudiness within Intel's client chip roadmap when it comes to their desktop processor plans for the next year, and how Meteor Lake may (or may not) fit into those. So this slight distinction on when the branding begins may be a sign that Intel isn't intending to launch high-end Meteor Lake desktop processors \\u2013 opening the door to a Raptor Lake refresh or the like.\\nFinally, following Intel's intended processor numbering scheme in the future, for both mainstream and Ultra chips, the processor model number will be after the word \\\"processor\\\". Intel's example is \\\"Intel Core Ultra 7 processor [model number]\\\" which isn't too much dissimilar to the current structure, albeit with the word 'Ultra' thrown in for good measure. This is to signify the target market of the processor, similar to how Intel used the Extreme moniker for their Core X-series processors.\\nIntel's Meteor Lake Cometh In H2'2023\\n\\nThe shift to the new branding and effectual removal of the 'i' from the said branding is interesting. While processor sales have declined over the last few years, the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and a general economic downturn have worsened matters. It remains to be seen whether or not these new changes are designed to promote an uptick in sales, e.g., selling more chips, or whether or not they represent making a change due to the massive generational shift in how Intel will be fabbing its processors \\u2013 both with regards to chiplets and the EUV-enabled Intel 4 process.\\nWith Meteor Lake not expected to splash down from the skies until\\u00a0later in 2023 for mobile and perhaps later on (if at all) in 2024 for desktop chips, Intel's latest Intel 4 process represents a massive shift in Intel's processor technologies. Meteor Lake is the first in Intel's arsenal to use EUV lithography in the manufacturing process, including using a similar approach to using both performance (P) and efficiency (E) cores, much like we've seen from both Alder Lake (12th Gen) and the current Raptor Lake (13th Gen) processors.\\u00a0\\nWithout diving much too into the meat of Meteor Lake and the advancements of what Intel 4 and TSMC's own processes bring to the table, our detailed coverage of Intel's upcoming Meteor Lake processors can be found below:\\n\\nIntel Discloses New Details On Meteor Lake VPU Block, Lays Out Vision For Client AI\\nIntel Details PowerVia Chipmaking Tech: Backside Power Performing Well, On Schedule For 2024\\nIntel Meteor Lake Client Processors to use Arc Graphics Chiplets\\nIntel: Meteor Lake & Intel 4 Process Now Ramping for Production\\n\\nGallery: Intel Core Meteor Lake Branding Slide Deck\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 308,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"on March 8, 2023 1:00 PM EST\",\n          \"on May 7, 2024 2:25 PM EST\",\n          \"on June 13, 2023 2:30 PM EST\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Thank you for understanding!\\n\\nAfter we already dealt with the topic of FSR and DLSS in terms of FPS increases last week, we want to take a look at the quality of the upscaling methods today. During my testing, I also noticed a few things that will help us clarify the variance issues related to NVIDIA graphics cards. So, it\\u2019s going to be interesting in any case, so I won\\u2019t beat around the bush, but start right away! Who has not yet watched the first part with the performance, here is the link again!\\nVisually pleasing pixel acceleration with upscaling? AMD follows up with FSR 2.0! Deathloop practice test with FSR vs. DLSS and a lot of measurements | Part 1 Performance\\n\\nI tested with my known test system. To make it easier to compare, all recordings (videos or pictures) were made with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. It is otherwise virtually impossible to guarantee the exact same position to ensure comparability \\u2013 since DLSS is only possible with NVIDIA RTX cards! The quality of FSR is exactly the same with AMD cards in both cases (FSR 1.0 and 2.0).\\n\\nTest system\\n\\n\\n\\nCPU\\nRyzen 7 5800X (PBO 2, CO negative)\\n\\n\\nMainboard \\nMSI MAG X570 ACE\\n\\n\\nRAM\\n4\\u00d78 GB Crucial Ballistix RGB 3600 MHz CL16-17-16-36 (OC)\\n\\n\\nSSD 1\\nSamsung 980 Pro 500 GB (System)\\n\\n\\nSSD 2\\nCrucial P2 1000 GB (Games)\\n\\n\\nSSD 3\\nCrucial P2 1000 GB (Games)\\n\\n\\nSSD 4\\nSamsung 512 GB 840 Pro (Backup)\\n\\n\\nCPU Cooler \\nAlphacool Eisbaer Aurora 360\\n\\n\\nPower supply unit\\nSeasonic Prime Platinum 1300 Watt\\n\\n\\nGPUs\\nMSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Suprim X \\u2013 water cooled ice block GPX Aurora (GeForce Driver 512.77)\\n\\n\\nSound\\nSoundblasterX AE-5 Plus\\n\\n\\nKeyboard \\nCooler Master SK 622 (Red Button) via USB @1000 Hz polling rate\\n\\n\\nMouse \\nASUS ROG Chakram Core @1000 Hz Polling Rate (NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer Support)\\n\\n\\nMonitor 1\\nASUS ROG Swift PG279QM @240 Hz via DP (Nvidia G-SYNC with Reflex Latency Analyzer)\\n\\n\\nMonitor 2 \\nLG 27GN950-B @144 Hz via DP (AMD FreeSync Premium, G-SYNC Compatible)\\n\\n\\n\\nAll tests ran on the LG 27GN950, here you can see a picture of how I perform the evaluation. For this I use a tool from NVIDIA (ICAT). This allows me to juxtapose up to 3 sources at the same time (side by side) or overlay them in split screen. At the same time, you can zoom into the images to see the differences in detail.\\u00a0\\n\\nWe then start by resolving the variance problems and then go into detail about the differences between FSR and DLSS. Even today, there are 3 resolutions (2160p, 1440p, and 1080p) as well as the two of the familiar upscaling levels (Ultra Quality (FSR 1.0) and Quality or Performance (DLSS and FSR 2.0). Thus, we have the quality matching the performance from the first part.

Even though this chip and the corresponding design as a gaming graphics card would place it very elegantly between a Radeon RX 7600 and the RX 7700XT, the focus of today\\u2019s test is on its use in productive applications.\\n\\nUnfortunately, availability in Germany is still close to zero, so of course I can\\u2019t give any street prices. But it can be assumed that even the RRP could still be just under the magic 1000 euro mark (or just over). That\\u2019s quite a statement, because you can compare the card with various counterparts from the NVIDIA cosmos. You can find out exactly where you end up in the conclusion, because you really have to differentiate fairly between areas where the Radeon Pro W7700 really performs well and those where the picture is rather mixed. Here, too, driver optimizations can certainly be made over time, but only the current status quo counts today, the rest can be checked later.\\n\\nWhere does AMD see this card?\\nThe Radeon Pro W7700 is AMD\\u2019s latest addition to the Radeon PRO series of graphics cards for workstation PCs and finally fills the aforementioned large gap in its own portfolio. This card is a mid-range model of the new generation and, despite its relatively low price, promises to deliver impressive performance in the areas of AI and CAD. Equipped with the RDNA 3 architecture and 16 GB GDDR6 memory, the W7700 offers an excellent price/performance ratio, which is said to be 1.7 times better than its predecessors, according to AMD.\\nThe Radeon Pro W7700 is specially designed for designers and creative professionals who want to improve their workflows in applications such as Solidworks, Adobe Premiere or Da Vinci Resolve. It offers up to 28 TFLOPS performance (in FP32 values) and is also well equipped for tasks involving ray tracing, with a corresponding number of ray accelerators and 48 compute units (CUs). In addition, it features AMD\\u2019s new Radiance Display Engine, which enables impressive resolutions and vivid color depths for projects on up to four displays.\\n\\nAs such, the Radeon Pro W7700 looks to be a strong choice for professionals looking for a powerful yet affordable graphics card for AI, CAD and other demanding applications. Its combination of advanced technology, high performance and competitive price makes it an interesting option in the world of workstation graphics cards, according to AMD. To verify this, I also tested full versions of Solidworks, Creo, Adobe Creative Cloud and other applications, but more on that in a moment.\\nThe Radeon Pro W7700 in detail\\nThe card in the black light metal dress with the chrome applications actually looks more massive than it really is. Ok, the blower design with the radial fan naturally helps to save weight, so that the scales ultimately only show 833 grams. For a 24.2 cm long card, that\\u2019s perfectly acceptable.\\nFrontBackBottomTopEndSlot PanelISO FrontISO RearFront Bottom\\nThe card is a true dual-slot design without a backplate, so that the net thickness is 3.5 cm (3.8 cm with the rear screws and the clamping cross). The installation height is based on the slot panel and is a standard 10.5 cm. Power is supplied via a normal 6 2 pin connector at the end of the card, so that no cables interfere with the installation.\\n\\nOn the slot bracket we find the necessary air outlet openings for the DHE principle of the card as well as a total of four DisplayPorts 2.1, which is actually sufficient for all situations in the areas where the card positions itself. Of course, this also puts a little finger in NVIDIA\\u2019s wound, as the current workstation graphics cards of the Ada generation are still stuck with version 1.4 of the DisplayPort with significantly lower throughput. Although it is considered more of a mid-range card in the new Radeon PRO series, with \\u201conly\\u201d half the RAM of the W7800 and half the CUs of the W7900, the price could make it an attractive option for many professional users.\\n\\nAI acceleration and AV1 codec support: The Radeon Pro W7700 offers hardware-based AI accelerators and supports the AV1 codec for efficient video encoding processes. This is especially useful for applications that benefit from AI enhancements, such as DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere.\\n\\n\\n\\nGPU Name\\nRDNA 3, Navi 32 (\\u201cWheat Nas\\u201d)\\n\\n\\nFoundry and Node\\nTSMC (5 nm GCD N5, 6 nm N6 MCD)\\n\\n\\nTransistors\\n28.1 billion (81.2 million per mm\\u00b2)\\n\\n\\nDie Size\\n346 mm\\u00b2 (200 mm\\u00b2 GCD, 4x 36.6 mm GCD)\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n16 GB GDDR6\\n\\n\\nMemory bus\\n256 bit (576.0 GB/s bandwidth)\\n\\n\\nShading units\\n3072\\n\\n\\nTMUs/ROPs\\n192 / 96\\n\\n\\nCUs/RT cores\\n48 / 48\\n\\n\\nL2 / L3 cache\\n2 MB / 64 MB\\n\\n\\nPower supply\\n1x 6 2 pin\\n\\n\\nTDP\\n190 Watts\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter I had tested the card in the original and \\u201cout of the box\\u201d, I of course also disassembled it thoroughly, you never know\\u2026 And curiosity always wins, of course.

Significant changes due to this update are not apparent for the time being.\\nImage Source: ASUS\\nHowever, one can assume that this is probably a BIOS firmware update that prepares for the upcoming Zen 5 architecture from AMD. This makes ASUS one of the other motherboard manufacturers that have already prepared various updates for this new architecture so that users can get started with AMD\\u2019s new Zen 5 architecture straight away.\\nImage Source: ASUS\\nAMD Zen 5 is supposed to be the successor to its Zen 4 architecture and offer significant performance improvements. There are currently no official details from AMD. However, it can be assumed that these chips will fit into the AM5 socket of motherboards and that if you still have an AM4 socket, you will have to replace your motherboard in order to enjoy the new Zen 5 processors. No further information is known, but fans and observers will not have to wait long before new information is rolled out. AMD will be presenting details of its architecture at this year\\u2019s Computex.\\nComputex is a major tech trade fair that runs from June 4 \\u2013 June 7, 2024 and will take place in Taipei. Major tech companies such as NVIDIA, ASUS, Intel and AMD will be represented at this trade fair. We can definitely expect some interesting innovations and projects to be presented at this trade fair and to drive the future forward. In any case, we are excited to see what AMD will present with its Zen 5 and how it will establish itself.

The decompression of graphics files is improved by DirectStorage 1.1, which works equally well for Intel, AMD and NVIDIA, but the blue team performs a bit better in the end. The latest benchmark test, developed by the website Compusemble, shows the technology\\u2019s performance first-hand and on the website\\u2019s YouTube channel. We have simply embedded the video once below for easy viewing :\\n\\nThe API allows the CPU to reduce the number of critical cycles needed for large tasks, and it decompresses game assets through \\u201chighly parallel\\u201d graphics cards without the OS doing the work, using the CPUI at a higher level to do so. DirectStorage 1.1 from Microsoft thus limits the load on the processor when the NVMe storage requests data. The algorithms used in DirectStorage\\u2019s asset compression and decompression allow it to move higher amounts of data than the NVMe SSD could normally handle natively.\\nSource: Tom\\u2019s Hardware Source: Tom\\u2019s Hardware\\n\\u00a0\\nPC Games Hardware, for example, pitted three very fast graphics cards on the market against each other for Compusemble\\u2019s benchmark test to see which handled data decompression best. The three GPUs tested by the website were:\\n\\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\\nIntel Arc A770\\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080\\n\\nAll three graphics cards were paired with the Intel Core i9-12900K processor from the Alder Lake generation. All three graphics cards processed decompression almost 2.5 times faster than the Intel processor. The Intel Arc A770 GPU performs better than AMD and NVIDIA in \\u201casset decompression\\u201d. The results show that the Intel Arc A770 can transfer and decompress assets at 16.8 GB/s, while the AMD RX 7900 XT processes the same information at 14.6 GB/s, or a difference of thirteen percent.\\nHowever, since the load times were reduced from five seconds to less than one second, all three graphics cards decompressed the data in a similar way, which means that both configurations would still perform better with DirectStorage 1.1 than the CPU ever could.\\nSource: TomsHardware, Compusemble, PC Games Hardware (PCGH)\\n\\n\",\n          \"\\nAs part of the IFS event, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that the company intends to enter the \\u201ccustomer chip\\u201d business in the future. Every customer is to be served, including the competitor AMD. This is reported by our colleagues at Tom\\u2019s Hardware USA.\\nImage Credit: Pat Gelsinger via X (Twitter)\\nThe market for customized chips is therefore becoming increasingly interesting. After NVIDIA and Intel announced their intentions to enter the custom chip business due to their strong supply chain and facilities, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger gave an interesting answer during a Q&A session when asked by a journalist what the company\\u2019s approach was.\\n\\nAI is creating an unprecedented opportunity for the world's most innovative chip designers. What we shared today is just a glimpse of what lies ahead for Intel Foundry.\\nThis moment was 3 years in the making and I'm proud of Team @Intel for the progress we\\u2019ve made.\\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xL28wFBPAu\\n\\u2014 Pat Gelsinger (@PGelsinger) February 21, 2024\\n\\nThere are two areas at Intel that he mentions. One is Intel Products and the other is Intel Foundry. There is to be a clear separation between the two areas, in which the business figures will also be published separately and will already take place this year. There is a clear goal for this \\u2013 to utilize the factories to capacity and thus supply a large number of customers as quickly as possible. He also explicitly mentions NVIDIA CEO Jensen, Qualcomm CEO Christiano, Google CEO Sundar and Microsoft CEO Satya, who he hopes will be future customers. He also hopes to be able to serve AMD CEO Lisa in the future.\\nImage Credit: Pat Gelsinger via X (Twitter)\\nGelsinger also expects that customers will want to use Intel products directly, but with different chiplets. For example, it should be possible to build a Clearwater Forest with the security chip or IO chip or another network component from a different manufacturer.\\nIntel has already had a few surprises in store and has successfully aroused the interest of the industry. It has already announced that it has secured a whopping 15 billion dollar contract from Microsoft to develop its own AI processors and accelerators. Microsoft is using Intel\\u2019s 18A process to produce one of its own chips. For more details, I recommend the full original article linked below.\\nSource: Tom\\u2019s Hardware\\n\\n\",\n          \"\\nIntel is also working on its own super-resolution technology for videos in Chrome browsers. There were already hints of such technology that Intel engineers referred to in Chrome development, but it was not entirely clear how and if it would work at all. As it turns out, this technology is already enabled for certain Intel GPUs, but it is not officially supported yet and requires a manual change to be enabled.\\n\\nThat is, there is no magic switch in the Intel graphics control panel of the driver, but a command that has to be entered manually for Chrome. Technology support depends on the architecture, but is reportedly available for 10th generation integrated GPUs. Generation and newer activated. Furthermore, it also works for Intel Arc, so the quality and performance will probably primarily depend on the hardware used as well. As for the requirements, Chrome must be at least version 109 (so it may be older than what is required for NVIDIA), hardware acceleration must be enabled for Chrome, and there must be a compatible GPU. Then a special command must be added to the app shortcut:\\n\\nSome users were quite lucky during activation and testing. Here are some examples of Intel VSR working for different video sources (Twitch, Bilibili):\\n  \\nResults may vary depending on the video source and GPU processing power. So far, VSR technology for video shows a visible performance load for GPUs, so it does not always justify its use. It is important to note that VSR is not officially supported by Intel, so we strongly recommend waiting for official support if it is a production system. In fact, Intel has not even confirmed that such a feature is planned yet. But as a curious user, experimenting with it is allowed.\\nSource: @SquashBionic, hddvddegogo, QuasarZone, Dcinside\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 167,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"12.
